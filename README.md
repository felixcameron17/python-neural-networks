#GUIDE

to run the program, run the 'run.py' file.
if you would like to mess around with the configuration, use the 'config.py' file and explore what happens


#DISCLAIMER

this project was done by following @BotAcademyYT's video on youtube:

prior to this video, i did not know how to make a neural network in Python.
as a result, a lot of the code is copied directly from thier video, however, i have commented on my code, in my own words, what the code does.
by following along with this video, i have been able to get a better understanding of neural networks

I have no intention to use this code to profit or pass it off as my own
