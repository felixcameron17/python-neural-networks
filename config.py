# these are the variables you can play around with.
# epochs is how many times to interate through the images. more epochs = better accuraccy

# imgs is how many numbers you want the network to guess, after it has trained.
# check the 'guesses' directory after to see what the network has guessed
# (images are chosen at random)

# learn rate is how fast you want the network to learn
# increasing the value will provide better results, at the cost of speed
